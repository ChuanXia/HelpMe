# HelpMe Pebble WatchApp + Android App

Do you worry about your children, your parents, or your grandparents' safety, that they will ever be in an emergency situation where they are not able to call or text you using their phone? 

HelpMe is a alarm system that notifies you when your loved ones' safety is endangered. The Pebble watchapp and Android app work together as an emergency notification system that sends a text message to you with your loved ones' geographic location through his/her Pebble watch in 2 situations:
- Sexual assault or abduction 

OR

- (For the elderly) slip or fall


HelpMe is designed and implemented during Pearl Hacks.
